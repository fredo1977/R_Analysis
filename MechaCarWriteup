Completing a multi-regression vehicle.length to mpg, we are able to note that these two variables do not provide a random amount of variance. The slope is not zero, it is positive. This is becuase the data tells us that the greater length of the vehicle, the greater the mpg. This linear model does not predict prototypes effectively as ther are other factors/variables that are not accounted for when calculating mpg.
